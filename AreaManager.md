# Area Manager

In the area manager, we can change the ruleset used in a specific area as well as change the priority the areas are cleaned in, lower means being cleaned first. Areas can also be managed through the inspector of the individual cleaning area. It can be accessed through `Tools / Scene Cleaner Pro / Area manager`
