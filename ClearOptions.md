# Clear options

The Cleaner options is where we can change things like where to look for saved rulesets and save new ones. We can also set if the options and rulesets open in the manager should be saved upon closing the window/on disable of not. It can be opened though `Tools/Scene Cleaner Pro/Cleaner options`
